        1. Choose whether to play single player (player vs computer) or multiplayer (player 1 vs player2). \n\n2. Enter the player’s name or if multiplayer, both players’ names. \n\n3. Enter the number of squares in a row you want to play the round with. (Squares can only be 9, 10 and 11) \n\n4. At the start of the round, dices are rolled to decide who plays the first turn. The player who rolls the maximum summed value of two dices goes first. \n\n5. The round starts with both players having their squares all uncovered. A player can either cover(GREEN tiles) his squares or uncover(RED tiles) his opponent’s squares. If a player covers all their own squares, then they are decided as the winner. The winner is also decided if a player uncovers all their opponent’s squares. However, the winner cannot be decided in the first round by uncovering opponent’s squares because all the squares are already uncovered at the start. \n\n6. If a player covers up all their squares greater than 6 (the squares 7-n) then they are allowed to throw only one die which maximizes their chances of winning. But they can decide not to throw one die.\n\n7. When a player wins, they are asked if they want to play another game. If the player chooses to play another round, the winning point of the round is calculated to a number that will be covered up at the start of the next round. This advantage is provided to the player who did not play the first turn in the current round.\n\n8. Until a player decides to either save and quit or quit the game, or not play another round, the game keeps on going and the player’s points are accumulated. The player that has greater accumulated points at the end of the game is declared as the winner.
